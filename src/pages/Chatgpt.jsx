                        To write an expert prompt, start by being clear and specific about your intentions. Remember that AI will do what you want it to do, as long as you explain it thoroughly and accurately. Avoid using ambiguous language or overloading the prompt with unnecessary details, which can lead to confusion and subpar results. üòï Instead, focus on providing concise and direct instructions to maximize the AI‚Äôs ability to understand and execute the task.
